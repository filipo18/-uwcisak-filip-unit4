Today's to do list:
1. Go though the videos on the khan academy
1. Create static website showing css and html skilss

First I wanted to skip the videos on khan academy, because I already know some basic stuff about HTML and CSS. But it turns out I don't really know what to do, because intstructions were not specific saying just "create a website". So I went through the videos to see what is expected from me. Then I created wesite based on what I learnd from videos and it was ugly. So I wanted to make it just a bit better looking. I spent too much time on css geting all the margins and pading right and website is still pretty ungly. I am not a fan of creating a website using just HTML and CSS, because the process of it is basiclly jsut trial and error. Even though what I did was quite simple it is still the most CSS I have done in in my life so far, because I always use **bootstrap** and it is really helpful with saving time and making website look better.
