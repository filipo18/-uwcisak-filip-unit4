Today's to do list:
1. Go though the videos on the khan academy
1. Create static website showing css and html skilss

First I wanted to skip the videos on khan academy, because I already know some basic stuff about HTML and CSS. But it turns out I don't really know what to do, because intstructions were not specific saying just "create a website". So I went through the videos to see what is expected from me. Then I created wesite based on what I learnd from videos and it was ugly. So I wanted to make it just a bit better looking. I spent too much time on css geting all the margins and pading right and website is still pretty ungly. I am not a fan of creating a website using just HTML and CSS, because the process of it is basiclly jsut trial and error. Even though what I did was quite simple it is still the most CSS I have done in in my life so far, because I always use **bootstrap** and it is really helpful with saving time and making website look better.

Today's to do list:
1. Do coding excercises
1. Do codin game
1. Watch a video and write a summary

I spent whole day on this 6 coding assingments. Java asignments took me so much time because I never did Java before. Especially the note one took me too much time. I couldn't get my note to show up and I still don't understand how it works. I googled for solution and for some reason I still can't figure it out. My vowel counter solution was probably super inefficient but it was the most straight forward one.

I though I will finnish with codin game excercises faster because it says they **easy** and I was allowed to use a pytong. But then I ended up spending whole evening on that because I find it really hard to uderstand what exaclty the game wants from me.

Internet was invented in small closed groups computers called LAN (local access network). Compters were connected together to make sharing information faster. Before that people needed to walk over with the magnetic tapes. This also proved to be super useful for shared storages and printers. There was one protocol that stood out and that was Enternet. It is still used today. All computers that are connected to same network has their own unique MAC adress. If computer wants to send a file to another computer, there is the target MAC adress in the header of that file. If both computers try to send a file at the same time. We get a collison. In that case file is transmited again 1s + some random time after. If we get a colision again next time computer doesn't wait one sec but 2, and then 4, and 8, and 16 and so on. This is called Exponential backoff. To avoid filling the nettwork with a big file, we divide big files into smaller packets. This is called pocket switching
